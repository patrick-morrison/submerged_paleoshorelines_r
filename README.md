# Mapping Submerged Paleoshorelines using R

This is the r code to create paleoshoreline reconstructions. Full details are available: https://padmorrison.com/post/submerged-landscapes-maps-in-r/

The Rottnest Shelf DEM is provided for convenience, and has been extracted from:

The only other thing this script needs to run is the Red Sea Level curve, found in the supplementary information of this paper:
